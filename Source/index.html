                Hamza's childhood was quite challenging for him. He wasn't
                taking care of his mental nor physical health so he became weak
                in both areas, also he was traumatized because of his family and
                surroundings and it made the situation worse.

                In his early 17s, Hamza was introduced to self improvement and
                started his self improvement journey by going to the gym
                regularly which made a huge impact on his life. Although he had
                his ups and downs, Hamza managed to stay consistant and changed
                his life for the better.

                Hamza decided to get into entrepreneurship in his 20s because
                his work wasn't meeting his needs, so he started his Youtube
                channel which was so helpfull for young men and because of its
                value it grew rapidly.

                I am glad to have met this legendery savior. I had a terrible
                life during high school. I was getting constantly bullied and
                couldn't even control my never ending desire of doing time
                wasting activities. If it wasn't because of my FTE moment at the
                end of highschool (FTE is known amongst hamza's fans) and
                because of me finding Hamza and letting him to lead me, I could
                never scape that hell. I could never thank him enough. I wish
                him and his girlfriend a beautiful and happy life.
